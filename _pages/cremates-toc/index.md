Su Xingyao was born with good looks and treated people sincerely, yet he was never liked by others.

After suffering hardships and eventually being taken back by his biological family, his parents showed him a cold face, caring only for their adopted son.

His fiancé gave all their resources to the adopted son, allowing people within their circle to bully and smear Su Xingyao without restraint.

Even the celebrity friend he risked his life to save from a fire didn’t say a word of thanks; instead, he turned around and devoted his kindness to the adopted son.

Netizens blindly sided with the adopted son, condemning Su Xingyao every day without reason.

Although he did nothing wrong, everyone despised him.

It wasn’t until he fell off a cliff that Su Xingyao discovered he was the foil character in a novel.

The adopted son, Shen Huaixi, was the protagonist of this world, naturally adored by everyone, while he was the scapegoat, branded as petty and cruel, with no one ever destined to like him.

After being reborn, Su Xingyao finally awakened.

He quickly left the Shen family and cut ties with everyone from his past.

From then on, his life took a fresh turn, and by a twist of fate, he even became friends with the biggest villain in the entire story.
