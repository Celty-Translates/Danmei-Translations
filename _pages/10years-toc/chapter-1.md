_Translator’s Note: Hi all! I decided to translate this novel because it’s relatively short and very silly! If you’ve read my other translations you’ve probably noticed that mpreg is kinda my thing, lol, so obviously this is another mpreg novel._

_Before starting I will just recommend you turn your brain off for a bit with this story. Everything happens very quickly, the writing isn’t very deep, and it’s neither profound nor complex, BUT it is a cute and fun little story. I enjoy simple stories on occasion and this is great for if you need a quick, easy read. Set your expectations accordingly and try not to be overly critical! Don’t get to the end and be like “this story was simple and lacked depth!” as if I am not warning you right now that it’s simple and lacks depth._

Around nine in the evening, Tang Yuan was curled up under his blanket, watching a movie on his phone. The film featured two men engaged in adult activities, and he couldn’t tear his eyes away from the well-built top with six-pack abs. As he watched, he began to drool.

People say that looking at plums quenches thirst, but for him, watching this movie did nothing to ease the hunger—both physical and mental—gnawing at him.

No, he couldn’t take it anymore. His ass had been itching for seven days, and he had endured it for seven days. He desperately wanted to find someone to fuck.

He was already eighteen, an adult. He had even taken the college entrance exam, so he didn’t need to overthink things. Tonight, he would find someone to end his virginity—no big deal.

He got out of bed, changed his clothes, and prepared to head out. But the moment he took a step, his legs went weak. Leaning against the wall, he gasped for breath, a sudden wave of despair washing over him.

He really was suffering from some strange illness. Starting seven days ago, his ass had been itching—the kind of itch that made him crave being fucked. But back then, it hadn’t been this severe. Now, just taking a single step made him unbearably itchy, and his fluids were practically flowing like a river.

What should he do? What could he do?

"Ha ha ha."

A burst of laughter echoed in his room. The sound was faint and elusive, and for a moment, Tang Yuan thought he had imagined it. But he knew he hadn’t.

"Who’s there?"

Ever since his last remaining family member had passed away, he had lived alone. But now, there was someone else in his house.

His heart pounded with growing tension, yet his body’s reaction only intensified. He wanted… he wanted…

Stop thinking about it! he scolded himself inwardly. There was an intruder in his home, and here he was fantasizing about such things. He pinched his thigh hard, trying to regain some rationality, but then the laughter came again.

"Ha ha ha." This time, he clearly heard it—a man’s voice. He could sense a hint of smugness in the laughter, which infuriated him.

"Come out!" he roared.

But no one answered. What the hell was going on? Fear and irritation churned inside him as he struggled to lean against the wall, searching for the intruder. He scoured the entire house but found no one. His body began to tremble violently—he knew he had reached his limit. If he didn’t find release soon, he might become the first person in history to die from sheer frustration.

But… using his hand wasn’t enough to satisfy him. So, was he really going to die in his own home tonight? The thought filled him with resentment. He had just turned eighteen—there were so many things he hadn’t even tried yet!

Even as resentment burned in his chest, his consciousness began to fade.

He didn’t know how long he had been unconscious, but he suddenly woke to the scent of a man’s clean, intoxicating fragrance. The moment he opened his eyes, he saw a man standing beside him.

The man’s features were as exquisite as a painting, his demeanor gentle and refined. Though his face was pale and blood trickled from the corner of his lips, he was still undeniably captivating.

He seemed surprised that Tang Yuan had woken up. After a brief pause, he spoke:

"Sorry, I—"

Before he could finish, Tang Yuan lunged at him.

Tang Yuan inhaled deeply, breathing in the man’s scent, and his eyes instantly darkened with desire. He pulled the man into a fierce kiss.

"You—" The man seemed to want to speak, but Tang Yuan kissed him again, murmuring:

"Don’t talk."

He then sucked lightly on the man’s lips, as if addicted, savoring the taste before whispering in a daze, "So delicious."

The man’s face flushed—whether from anger or embarrassment, it was hard to tell. He struggled to push Tang Yuan away, but Tang Yuan was naturally strong, and the man was injured. Unable to break free, his lips were soon captured again.

Tang Yuan pried open the man’s mouth, his tongue eagerly but clumsily teasing the other’s, chasing it as it tried to retreat. The man’s body trembled slightly—whether from fear or excitement, it was unclear. Then, finally, the man responded, gently pressing his tongue against Tang Yuan’s.

That single touch shattered what little restraint Tang Yuan had left.

Just as Tang Yuan was losing himself further, a sharp pain struck the back of his neck, and he blacked out once more.

Everything had happened in a haze, so Tang Yuan dismissed it all as a dream. When he woke up the next morning, he was filled with frustration. Even in his dreams, he couldn’t enjoy himself properly—the man had kissed him and then just disappeared.

He knew the truth now: that guy must have been impotent.

The dream left Tang Yuan dissatisfied, but a few days later, he was pleasantly surprised to discover that his strange illness had vanished, and his physical condition had actually improved.

With his recovery, Tang Yuan finally relaxed. So, he called up his best friend, Zhao Zheng, for some grilled skewers.

Tang Yuan was exceptionally good-looking, with mesmerizing peach-blossom eyes that had charmed countless men and women. Handsome people often had a vain streak, and Tang Yuan was no exception. He spent an hour primping before leaving the house, only to arrive at the skewer spot and find Zhao Zheng already eating.

Tang Yuan thought this was utterly disloyal, so he immediately swiped the food from Zhao Zheng’s plate, grumbling as he ate:

"You didn’t even wait for me."

"At least leave me a couple!" Zhao Zheng protested, trying to snatch some back, but to no avail. He had no choice but to order more from the vendor.

"I never win against you," Zhao Zheng grumbled. "Are you even human?"

Tang Yuan munched on his skewers, shooting him a smug look that made Zhao Zheng’s blood boil. He tried to grab some again but failed just as miserably.

Tang Yuan smirked. "Tsk tsk tsk, are you a masochist? You know you can’t win against me, yet you keep trying."

Zhao Zheng: "No, you’re the abnormal one. You’re as strong as an ox."

"You’re just jealous," Tang Yuan taunted between bites, thoroughly pleased with himself.

Zhao Zheng swallowed his frustration, thinking that maybe he really was a masochist. He knew Tang Yuan was unbeatable, yet he kept challenging him. But Tang Yuan really wasn’t normal—despite his slender frame, his strength was freakishly high. He could lift Zhao Zheng with one hand.

Zhao Zheng fell silent, taking a sip of his beer. Tang Yuan paused mid-bite, studying him carefully before asking:

"Are you mad?"

Zhao Zheng shook his head. "No, I wouldn’t get mad over something like this."

"Then what’s wrong?" Tang Yuan could tell something was off—this wasn’t like Zhao Zheng’s usual behavior.

"My dad might be cheating," Zhao Zheng muttered gloomily.

He hadn’t planned to tell anyone, but Tang Yuan was his closest friend, and the alcohol loosened his tongue. So, he spilled everything, ending with:

"Now he comes home late every night, reeking of women’s perfume. Sometimes, there are even lipstick stains on his clothes. But even with all that, he still denies cheating."

Tang Yuan sighed, unsure how to comfort him. He could only pat his back and pour him another beer.

Seeing Zhao Zheng in such a state, Tang Yuan decided to walk him home. But when they reached Zhao Zheng’s doorstep, Tang Yuan suddenly felt someone’s gaze on him—a gaze that made him deeply uncomfortable. He looked around but found no one watching.

Since Zhao Zheng seemed fine, Tang Yuan chalked it up to his imagination. After saying goodbye, he headed home.

That night, as he was showering, he caught a glimpse of a child crouching in the corner out of the corner of his eye. The child’s face was paler than paper, its eyes fixed blankly on him.

Tang Yuan startled, stumbling backward and nearly falling. When he steadied himself and looked again, the corner was empty.

Had he imagined it?

The incident killed his mood for showering, so he quickly finished up and left the bathroom.

He barely slept that night, leaving him exhausted the next day when he went job-hunting. Over the following days, the hallucinations persisted—sometimes a ghostly face floating in his bowl while he ate, other times a pair of feet outside the bathroom door.

These hallucinations took a toll on his life. He couldn’t sleep at night, and dark circles formed under his eyes.

Boom! A clap of thunder jolted Tang Yuan awake. He checked his phone—it was only 2 a.m.

Now wide awake, the pitch-black room unsettled him. He reached for the light switch, but his eyes caught a shadowy figure by the window.

He blinked, wondering if it was another hallucination. But the figure remained.

His face remained calm as he kept his eyes locked on the shadow while flipping the switch. The light came on—and the figure vanished.

He exhaled in relief, assuming it must have been the shadow of a tree outside.

Wait… his apartment was on the seventh floor. The trees below weren’t tall enough to cast shadows up here. So, what had that been? A burglar?

But would a burglar climb this high?

He turned the light off again. The shadow reappeared, unchanged. A burglar wouldn’t stay frozen like that, and there was no ledge outside his window. So, it wasn’t a burglar!

He turned the light back on, and the shadow disappeared again. He couldn’t make sense of it. Had the trees below grown taller?

Maybe he was overthinking it. He should just sleep and check tomorrow. He turned off the light once more, his eyes instinctively darting to the window. This time, the shadow was gone.

Just as he was about to turn the light back on, he noticed a dark figure standing beside his bed.

Tang Yuan froze, staring unblinkingly at the figure. Then, he felt something cold around his neck. Looking down, he saw a pair of pale hands gripping his throat.

Whether his eyes had adjusted to the dark or something else, he could now see the figure clearly—a woman’s face, deathly pale, her eyes bulging unnaturally, as if they might fall out at any moment.

This was undeniably a ghost!

Tang Yuan’s expression turned numb. So, none of it had been hallucinations—he really was being haunted. Remembering the torment of the past few days, a surge of fury rose in his chest.

Gritting his teeth, he spat:

"You really think I’m easy to bully, huh?"
